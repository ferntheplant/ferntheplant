## Hi This Is Fern ðŸŒ¿

I'm a big math and computer nerd. I've worked everywhere doing everything from engineering at Google and non-profits to founding my own company and teaching in public schools. Most recently I wrapped up a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in Summer 2024 and am now a Software Engineer at [withco](https://with.co/) empowering small businesses to own their real estate.
