## Hi This Is Fern ðŸŒ¿

I'm a big math and computer nerd especially interested in web technologies along with machine learning, personal computing, dev tooling, and local-first technologies. I've worked everywhere doing everything from engineering at Google and non-profits to founding my own company and teaching in public schools. I wrapped up a batch at the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in Summer 2024 and am looking to get back into professional engineering. 


- ðŸ§  Currently learning: Machine Learning (via [ARENA](https://github.com/callummcdougall/ARENA_3.0)) and Math (currently on [Measure Theory](https://measure.axler.net/))
- ðŸ”¨ Currently working on: [Hobo](https://github.com/ferntheplant/hobo) - a better UX for tracking multi-connection commutes from Hoboken to NYC
- ðŸ’¬ Let's talk about: browsers, terminals, ricing, and everything about customizing your personal computer experience
